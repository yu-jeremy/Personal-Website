        <h4 class="card-title">Fall 2017: Some Thoughts on My Semester</h4>
        <h6 class="subtitle card-subtitle text-muted">Time flies when you're...stressed?</h6>
        <div class="content card-text">
          <p class="lead">The fall semester of my sophomore year is over and I'm back home. To sum up my time in St. Louis
          during these past few months, I would just say...well, it was different. Yeah, that's pretty dumb, but after thinking about the semester for a while, I couldn't quite come up with another way to describe the experience. A few quick points as I reflect, for myself to remember:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Stress makes me a hermit.</strong>
              <p>This semester was certainly stressful. Many factors were involved but my decision making early on in the semester did not help, particularly in regards to my course load. Simply put, I recognized a while ago that taking one less class would have done wonders for my health, my schedule/commitments, and my faith. More so than previous semesters, I realized that stress keeps me holed up, physically away and spiritually distant from others. These kinds of observations have pushed me to ridicule and tear myself down in the past: "You could have been more productive during _____" and "Why can't you just be better?" characterize the type of sentiments in my head during such times. Additionally, I have had an irrational feeling of needing to prove myself <i>to myself</i> for quite some time now, which has constantly placed my own standards before God's. In the end...good comes out of this semester: my outlook on next semester has been informed by the result of pushing myself to places I didn't want to be this semester. To put time into the handful of things I know God has purposefully involved me in. To discern carefully when taking on more responsibilities. And to trust that more is not better when world tells me that it is. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>The people make the place.</strong>
              <p>Washington University is special to me because of the people I've met there. This is my reply when someone about "making the right college decision". Yes, I can easily imagine myself finding similar <i>forms</i> of community at some other university, but what really makes these forms at WashU different from corresponding ones at other schools? The people. I am grateful for all the friends I have made at school and I really do hope the coming semesters will confirm this sentiment. Many say that you'll never have four years quite like college and I absolutely agree...because I will never go through the process of meeting the people I've met again. Because I will never journey from the unknown to the familiar with these same communities again. Because I had that conversation, that meal, or that study session with those people at that time. The best thing about it? There's more people coming every year!</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Year in Sports...So Far.</strong>
              <p>From an NFL season riddled with injuries to franchising in the League of Legends pro scene, this year in sports has definitely...well, been interesting. You might have even heard that the World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships are being held in Saudi Arabia...which has caused a bit of <a href="https://www.chess.com/news/view/fide-criticised-for-hosting-world-rapid-blitz-in-saudi-arabia">controversy. </a>And how about the Philadelphia Eagles making the leap along with second-year QB Carson Wentz only to see their star get <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000891467/article/carson-wentz-suffers-torn-acl-in-win-over-rams">injured</a> during a crucial game against the Rams? Crazy, crazy stuff. Other honorable mentions include a wild Steelers vs. Patriots game, the Yankees signing Giancarlo Stanton, and Usain Bolt losing out on 100m gold in the last race of his professional track career.  More is coming...I'll just have to wait another 5 minutes.</p>  
            </li>

            <li><strong>Honoring God with My Body</strong>
              <p>Treating my body like a temple (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6:19-20">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>) has been something I've struggled with in the past. I guess it goes against what the world tells me about being a college student (and maybe part of this carries over from a competitive high school environment). This semester, sleep wasn't exactly a regular part of my schedule, which is partially why I appreciate having this winter break. I've found that I buy into the "do more" mantra ("Everyone's overcommitted at WashU") very easily; in other words, it's been easy for me to buy into what the world is saying about how I should be going about my college career. In relation to a point above, a positive that has come out of this particular aspect of my semester is an increased awareness of my limits, both physical and mental.

                You made what was good, bad,<br>

                  What a time it is in the sports world. Then again, is it never a time? There have been huge competitions happening
                  all over the place but today I'm going to focus on two of my favorite sports: American football and chess. These two
                  sports could not possibly be more different but here we are. Let's go!
              </p>
              <p>To start off, we're going to move back to 2018 and review some of the exciting chess events that happened in 
                December. First off, the King Salman World Rapid & Blitz Tournaments. Having watched these tournaments last year,
                I was excited to see how things would turn out this year. Before we dive into what actually happened, a brief overview
                of how these two tournaments are different from the official World Chess Championship. The WCC is a chess <em>match</em>
                played between the current world chess champion (you may have heard of Magnus Carlsen from Norway before) and a challenger
                who must qualify for the match via a Candidates Tournament played against several other top-20 players. Additionally, the players 
                involved in the WCC play classical chess, a form of chess that typically lasts for many hours. Under this format, players typically 
                start with over an hour on their clock and can only gain more time after having played a certain number of moves. On the other
                hand, The World Rapid & Blitz Tournaments are never played between just two individuals. Invitations were sent to 
                hundreds of players, some more well known than others, and hundreds of games happen during each round of what is traditionally called a 
                Swiss tournament. This tournament format guarantees that a player never plays any other player more than once. Despite the massive number
                of skilled players, the top grandmasters usually rise to the top. This year, Daniil Dubov, an unexpected winner, emerged to take the World Rapid
                Trophy. Dubov is an up and coming 22 year old Russian grandmaster who is bound for more achievements of this magnitude in the future.
              </p>

              <p>
                As for the World Blitz Tournament, a not so unfamiliar grandmaster took the crown: World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Carlsen went undefeated
                in 21 rounds of chess and repeated as World Blitz Champion for the second year in a row. Having initially stumbled in the early rounds of 
                the World Rapid Tournament, Carlsen was grateful and excited to end the year by adding another trophy to his growing collection (he had won
                the World Chess Championship in November). His reflections can be found <a href="https://www.arctic.com/secno/en/magnus-carlsens-blog/world-rapid-blitz-and-tata-steel">here.</a>
