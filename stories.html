          <p>What does it mean to be made in God's image? A few resources I'm reflecting on as I write this are below:

          be mentioning down the line.

          <p>Tom Brady points me to Christ. Regardless of whether Brady
          is a religious man or not (he has never been outspoken about any religious beliefs), the observations that
          follow more closely relate to Deflategate and thoughts I had as that controversy spun out of control. If 
          you have no idea what any of these things are, here are a few links to helpful resources if you want to learn
          more.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://bit.ly/1GPvcnP">Deflategate Report</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://bit.ly/22xqCsw">Deflategate (general)</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://bit.ly/2kcghkv">Brady</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://bit.ly/2A3aXvi">Who's Jesus?</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Ok, now for some context. Deflategate, considered to be a sports scandal (and one of many involving the 
          New England Patriots football team), became a thing nearly three years ago. More specifically, this controversy
          was born during and grew after a game between the Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts, who were playing in a conference championship game during the 2014-2015 NFL playoffs. The winner of this game would have an opportunity to play in Superbowl XLIX against the Seattle Seahawks. During this game, some Patriot footballs were found to be 
          under-inflated (below the league's PSI standard) and after the game, a full-on investigation was initiated by the 
          league (specifically investigating Tom Brady's involvement and the situation in general). While there are already a host of mix-ups and unknowns related to why the league decided to investigate, 
          those will not be mentioned here. We move to another side of things now: what was this like for Patriots fans?
          </p>
          <p>I remember telling myself that this controversy was (and still is) stupid. Deflated footballs? Seriously? I 
          understood the league's view from an integrity standpoint: maybe they were trying to set some sort of standard. 
          Reflecting on the game, many fans were exasperated because the Patriots won 45-7. For fans of other teams, 
          what they had believed to be true about the Patriots was confirmed: once a cheater, always a cheater (see Spygate) In the following weeks, many Patriots fans sat seething in front of their computer screens as other fandoms relished in making an uncountable number of jokes about deflated footballs, Brady, and the Patriots organization.

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">Probably won't find this on my breakfast menu.</figcaption>
          </figure> 
          <p>Since the league's investigation was focused on Brady (the investigation's conclusion was that Brady <strong>most likely</strong> new about what was going on with the deflated footballs and that <strong>"it is more probable than not"</strong> that the Patriots broke league rules in regards to ball regulations), Brady was the 
          one who went to court, with the NFLPA by his side. Brady's initial appeal did not change the league's 4-game 
          suspension ruling. When taken to a district judge, the suspension was removed. The league then appealed and this 
          appeal was also heard by a federal appeals court, eventually swaying things in the other direction yet again. This court ruled to reinstate Brady's suspension and Brady's next appeal was refused, which prompted Brady to make
          a decision about whether or not he would take his case to the Supreme Court. He didn't, and served the 4-game suspension at the beginning of the 2016-2017 NFL season. With all this in mind...
          </p>
          <p>Now that I think about it, Brady taking the suspension at the time he did was a good call. At the time, 
          Patriots fans continued to lament about the numerous injustices associated with Brady's case. As some of you
          might know, you can be a fan of a sports team and then you can be THAT fan; the fan who gets so worked up about 
          anything that has to do with their favorite team that <i>they start to lose sight of human reason</i>. After all, it is just a game, being played by others. Yes, sitting down on the couch on Thanksgiving Day to watch football might as well be synonymous with the holiday itself, but I would argue that supporting a team should not put us in a place where that team's ups and downs dictate our own ups and downs (I'm really just calling myself out here). Exceptions would be made for players and those involved with the teams in some capacity (and even then, we can discuss how "life is bigger than football" or "life is bigger than __________"). 
          </p>

          <p>Here's where we rope in some thoughts about faith. Most of the frustrations expressed by Patriots fans in response to the NFL's "attack" on Tom Brady and the Patriots organization were centered around perceived injustices. Many thought the Wells Report was complete BS and stood by Brady and the team for this reason.
