          <p>
            At two recent but separate instances of small group, we studied the two passages above, the Genesis passage and then the one from Mark. From the Genesis passage, we learned about how God made man in His own image and we discussed what that tells us about God's goodness. In Mark, we see how Jesus uses us (more like <i>includes us in</i>) when performing miracles. First...the first passage:
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's start with some context for the passage. The first few verses of Genesis tell us that God has been creating the world out of nothing, forming the sky, the oceans, and everything in between. During the previous day (the 5th day), God had made creatures of all kinds; sea creatures, land animals, and birds. God starts the 6th day by creating <i>more</i> living creatures (1:24-25: making creatures "according to their kinds"). After this, God proceeds to make man! In verse 26, God starts by saying: 
            <div class="my-5 mx-auto quotation text-container">
            <small>"Let <mark>us</mark> make man in <mark>our</mark> image, after <mark>our</mark> likeness [...]."</small></div>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Who is "us" if God is the only one speaking? Christians typically think of this "us" as the Holy Trinity, which is made up God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, all three being fully God but each being one distinct <i>person</i> (from "Holy, Holy, Holy": "God in three persons, blessed Trinity..."). While the word "trinity" is never explicitly stated in the Bible, we can be reminded that the familiar words of "I now baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit" are Biblically-based. In Matthew 28:19-20, we see the following is said by Jesus himself as he addresses his disciples in the Great Commission (meaning we are commissioned too through baptism!): 
           <div class="my-5 mx-auto quotation text-container">
            <small>"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them <mark>in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit</mark>, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age."</small>
          </div>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is one of the things I noticed about the Genesis passage. The logical next question(s): 
            <ul>
              <li>What does it mean for man to be made in God's image, given how God speaks creation into existence? What does it mean to be made in the image of "us", or the Holy Trinity?</li>
            </ul>
            To begin to answer this question: being made in the image of God (and effectively recognizing and living that out) starts with having a relationship with Him. A relationship with God shares some characteristics with relationships you might have with your friends, family, and/or significant other; namely, a relationship with God, like any earthly relationship, grows <strong>if</strong> you spend time with the other party, and in this case, the other party is God. The result of spending time with Him is a life that is visibly reflective of who God is; we are meant to enact the psychological behavior of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirroring_(psychology)">mirroring</a> in God's intended blueprint for mankind but we effectively carry this out by being in constant relationship with the original architect, God. 
          </p>  
          <p>
            Ok, so maybe we've heard this before but do these thoughts change when we look at God as "us", as made up of three persons? I wouldn't say so. I would say that it gives us an increasingly-detailed outline of God's intentions for mankind. The Holy Trinity, while consisting of three distinct persons, are unified and before the events documented in Genesis (when time didn't exist), the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit formed a community, a community in fellowship with each other. In the same way, we, mankind, are not just meant to have a relationship with God but also relationships with the rest of our kind. God was in fellowship with...well, Himself, and He also created man to be this way, to be in fellowship with man.
          </p>
          <p>
            So how does this have anything to with some sort of process? Well, being made for a relationship with God and others <i>takes time</i>. I have often struggled with a related question in the past: why couldn't God just spawn a bunch of humans who glorify Him and sing His praises without having to endure all of the dumb things man has done? We can quickly look at the passage from Mark to see what God might have to say:

            <div class="my-5 mx-auto quotation text-container">
              <small><sup>30</sup>The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught. <sup>31</sup>And he said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.” For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. <sup>32</sup>And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves. <sup>33</sup>Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. <sup>34</sup>When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things. 
              <sup>35</sup>And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is now late. <sup>36</sup>Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.” <sup>37</sup><mark>But he answered them, “You give them something to eat.”</mark> And they said to him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?” <sup>38</sup>And he said to them, <mark>“How many loaves do you have?</mark> Go and see.” And when they had found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.” <sup>39</sup>Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass. <sup>40</sup>So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. <sup>41</sup>And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And he divided the two fish among them all. <sup>42</sup>And they all ate and were satisfied. <sup>43</sup>And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish. <sup>44</sup>And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.</small>
            </div>
          </p>
          <p>
            You've probably also heard of this story, whether you are Christian or not. Jesus multiplies a handful of food (that would probably only feed a handful of people) so that five thousand people are fed! If we look at the highlighted parts of the passage, we see that Jesus pushes His disciples to somehow use their own resources to feed the crowd. Furthermore, in verse 38, He asks them about what they have to give (prompting them to gather food from the crowd). Here, we take a closer look at that part of the story by moving to the book of John. John 6:8-9 says:
            <div class="my-5 mx-auto quotation text-container">
              <small><sup>8</sup>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him, <sup>9</sup>"<mark>There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish</mark>, but what are they for so many?"</small>
            </div>
          </p>
          <p>
            In Mark, we are told that the disciples "found out" how much food the crowds had. John tells us who the food came from. The five loaves and two fish were not collected from thousands, hundreds, or even tens of people in the crowd. <strong>The food came from one boy!</strong>

            this is a process that we KNOW the result of...unlike any NBA's team rebuilding process

        <h4 class="card-title">Fall 2017: Some Thoughts on My Semester</h4>
        <h6 class="subtitle card-subtitle text-muted">Time flies when you're...stressed?</h6>
        <div class="content card-text">
          <p class="lead">The fall semester of my sophomore year is over and I'm back home. To sum up my time in St. Louis
          during these past few months, I would just say...well, it was different. Yeah, that's pretty dumb, but after thinking about the semester for a while, I couldn't quite come up with another way to describe the experience. A few quick points as I reflect, for myself to remember:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Stress makes me a hermit.</strong>
              <p>This semester was certainly stressful. Many factors were involved but my decision making early on in the semester did not help, particularly in regards to my course load. Simply put, I recognized a while ago that taking one less class would have done wonders for my health, my schedule/commitments, and my faith. More so than previous semesters, I realized that stress keeps me holed up, physically away and spiritually distant from others. These kinds of observations have pushed me to ridicule and tear myself down in the past: "You could have been more productive during _____" and "Why can't you just be better?" characterize the type of sentiments in my head during such times. Additionally, I have had an irrational feeling of needing to prove myself <i>to myself</i> for quite some time now, which has constantly placed my own standards before God's. In the end...good comes out of this semester: my outlook on next semester has been informed by the result of pushing myself to places I didn't want to be this semester. To put time into the handful of things I know God has purposefully involved me in. To discern carefully when taking on more responsibilities. And to trust that more is not better when world tells me that it is. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>The people make the place.</strong>
              <p>Washington University is special to me because of the people I've met there. This is my reply when someone about "making the right college decision". Yes, I can easily imagine myself finding similar <i>forms</i> of community at some other university, but what really makes these forms at WashU different from corresponding ones at other schools? The people. I am grateful for all the friends I have made at school and I really do hope the coming semesters will confirm this sentiment. Many say that you'll never have four years quite like college and I absolutely agree...because I will never go through the process of meeting the people I've met again. Because I will never journey from the unknown to the familiar with these same communities again. Because I had that conversation, that meal, or that study session with those people at that time. The best thing about it? There's more people coming every year!</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Year in Sports...So Far.</strong>
              <p>From an NFL season riddled with injuries to franchising in the League of Legends pro scene, this year in sports has definitely...well, been interesting. You might have even heard that the World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships are being held in Saudi Arabia...which has caused a bit of <a href="https://www.chess.com/news/view/fide-criticised-for-hosting-world-rapid-blitz-in-saudi-arabia">controversy. </a>And how about the Philadelphia Eagles making the leap along with second-year QB Carson Wentz only to see their star get <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000891467/article/carson-wentz-suffers-torn-acl-in-win-over-rams">injured</a> during a crucial game against the Rams? Crazy, crazy stuff. Other honorable mentions include a wild Steelers vs. Patriots game, the Yankees signing Giancarlo Stanton, and Usain Bolt losing out on 100m gold in the last race of his professional track career.  More is coming...I'll just have to wait another 5 minutes.</p>  
            </li>

            <li><strong>Honoring God with My Body</strong>
              <p>Treating my body like a temple (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6:19-20">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>) has been something I've struggled with in the past. I guess it goes against what the world tells me about being a college student (and maybe part of this carries over from a competitive high school environment). This semester, sleep wasn't exactly a regular part of my schedule, which is partially why I appreciate having this winter break. I've found that I buy into the "do more" mantra ("Everyone's overcommitted at WashU") very easily; in other words, it's been easy for me to buy into what the world is saying about how I should be going about my college career. In relation to a point above, a positive that has come out of this particular aspect of my semester is an increased awareness of my limits, both physical and mental.
