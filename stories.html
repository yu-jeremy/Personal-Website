          <p>
            At two recent but separate instances of small group, we studied the two passages above, the Genesis passage and then the one from Mark. From the Genesis passage, we learned about how God made man in His own image and we discussed what that tells us about God's goodness. In Mark, we see how Jesus uses us (more like <i>includes us in</i>) when performing miracles. First...the first passage:
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's start with some context for the passage. The first few verses of Genesis tell us that God has been creating the world out of nothing, forming the sky, the oceans, and everything in between. During the previous day (the 5th day), God had made creatures of all kinds; sea creatures, land animals, and birds. God starts the 6th day by creating <i>more</i> living creatures (1:24-25: making creatures "according to their kinds"). After this, God proceeds to make man! In verse 26, God starts by saying: 
            <div class="my-5 mx-auto quotation text-container">
            <small>"Let <mark>us</mark> make man in <mark>our</mark> image, after <mark>our</mark> likeness [...]."</small></div>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Who is "us" if God is the only one speaking? Christians typically think of this "us" as the Holy Trinity, which is made up God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, all three being fully God but each being one distinct <i>person</i> (from "Holy, Holy, Holy": "God in three persons, blessed Trinity..."). While the word "trinity" is never explicitly stated in the Bible, we can be reminded that the familiar words of "I now baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit" are Biblically-based. In Matthew 28:19-20, we see the following is said by Jesus himself as he addresses his disciples in the Great Commission (meaning we are commissioned too through baptism!): 
           <div class="my-5 mx-auto quotation text-container">
            <small>"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them <mark>in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit</mark>, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age."</small>
          </div>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is one of the things I noticed about the Genesis passage. The logical next question(s): 
            <ul>
              <li>What does it mean for man to be made in God's image, given how God speaks creation into existence? What does it mean to be made in the image of "us", or the Holy Trinity?</li>
            </ul>
            To begin to answer this question: being made in the image of God (and effectively recognizing and living that out) starts with having a relationship with Him. A relationship with God shares some characteristics with relationships you might have with your friends, family, and/or significant other; namely, a relationship with God, like any earthly relationship, grows <strong>if</strong> you spend time with the other party, and in this case, the other party is God. The result of spending time with Him is a life that is visibly reflective of who God is; we are meant to enact the psychological behavior of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirroring_(psychology)">mirroring</a> in God's intended blueprint for mankind but we effectively carry this out by being in constant relationship with the original architect, God. 
          </p>  
          <p>
            Ok, so maybe we've heard this before but do these thoughts change when we look at God as "us", as made up of three persons? I wouldn't say so. I would say that it gives us an increasingly-detailed outline of God's intentions for mankind. The Holy Trinity, while consisting of three distinct persons, are unified and before the events documented in Genesis (when time didn't exist), the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit formed a community, a community in fellowship with each other. In the same way, we, mankind, are not just meant to have a relationship with God but also relationships with the rest of our kind. God was in fellowship with...well, Himself, and He also created man to be this way, to be in fellowship with man.
          </p>
          <p>
            So how does this have anything to with some sort of process? Well, being made for a relationship with Him and others <i>takes time</i>. I have often struggled with a related question in the past: why couldn't God just spawn a bunch of humans who glorify Him and sing His praises without having to endure all of the dumb things man has done? We can quickly look at the passage from Mark to see what God might be saying: 

            <div class="my-5 mx-auto quotation text-container">
              <small><sup>30</sup>The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught. <sup>31</sup>And he said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.” For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. <sup>32</sup>And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves. <sup>33</sup>Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. <sup>34</sup>When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things. 
              <sup>35</sup>And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is now late. <sup>36</sup>Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.” <sup>37</sup><mark>But he answered them, “You give them something to eat.”</mark> And they said to him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?” <sup>38</sup>And he said to them, <mark>“How many loaves do you have?</mark> Go and see.” And when they had found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.” <sup>39</sup>Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass. <sup>40</sup>So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. <sup>41</sup>And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And he divided the two fish among them all. <sup>42</sup>And they all ate and were satisfied. <sup>43</sup>And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish. <sup>44</sup>And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.</small>
            </div>
          </p>
          <p>
            You've probably also heard of this story, whether you are Christian or not. Jesus multiplies a handful of food (that would probably only feed a handful of people) so that five thousand people are fed! If we look at the highlighted parts of the passage, we see that Jesus pushes His disciples to somehow use their own resources to feed the crowd. Furthermore, in verse 38, He asks them about what they have to give (prompting them to gather food from the crowd). Here, we take a closer look at that part of the story by moving to the book of John. John 6:8-9 says:
            <div class="my-5 mx-auto quotation text-container">
              <small><sup>8</sup>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him, <sup>9</sup>"<mark>There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish</mark>, but what are they for so many?"</small>

            this is a process that we KNOW the result of...unlike any NBA's team rebuilding process

          <p>Tom Brady points me to Christ. Regardless of whether Brady
          is a religious man or not (he has never been outspoken about any religious beliefs), the observations that
          follow more closely relate to Deflategate and thoughts I had as that controversy spun out of control. If 
          you have no idea what any of these things are, here are a few links to helpful resources if you want to learn
          more.</p>
          <ul>

            <li><a href="http://bit.ly/2A3aXvi">Who's Jesus?</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Ok, now for some context. Deflategate, considered to be a sports scandal (and one of many involving the 
          New England Patriots football team), became a thing nearly three years ago. More specifically, this controversy
          was born during and grew after a game between the Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts, who were playing in a conference championship game during the 2014-2015 NFL playoffs. The winner of this game would have an opportunity to play in Superbowl XLIX against the Seattle Seahawks. During this game, some Patriot footballs were found to be 
          under-inflated (below the league's PSI standard) and after the game, a full-on investigation was initiated by the 
          league (specifically investigating Tom Brady's involvement and the situation in general). While there are already a host of mix-ups and unknowns related to why the league decided to investigate, 
          those will not be mentioned here. We move to another side of things now: what was this like for Patriots fans?
          </p>
          <p>I remember telling myself that this controversy was (and still is) stupid. Deflated footballs? Seriously? I 
          understood the league's view from an integrity standpoint: maybe they were trying to set some sort of standard. 
          Reflecting on the game, many fans were exasperated because the Patriots won 45-7. For fans of other teams, 
          what they had believed to be true about the Patriots was confirmed: once a cheater, always a cheater (see Spygate) In the following weeks, many Patriots fans sat seething in front of their computer screens as other fandoms relished in making an uncountable number of jokes about deflated footballs, Brady, and the Patriots organization.
          </p>

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">Probably won't find this on my breakfast menu.</figcaption>
          </figure> 
          <p>Since the league's investigation was focused on Brady (the investigation's conclusion was that Brady <strong>most likely</strong> new about what was going on with the deflated footballs and that <strong>"it is more probable than not"</strong> that the Patriots broke league rules in regards to ball regulations), Brady was the 
          one who went to court, with the NFLPA by his side. Brady's initial appeal did not change the league's 4-game 
          suspension ruling. When taken to a district judge, the suspension was removed. The league then appealed and this 
          appeal was also heard by a federal appeals court, eventually swaying things in the other direction yet again. This court ruled to reinstate Brady's suspension and Brady's next appeal was refused, which prompted Brady to make
          a decision about whether or not he would take his case to the Supreme Court. He didn't, and served the 4-game suspension at the beginning of the 2016-2017 NFL season. With all this in mind...
          </p>
          <p>Now that I think about it, Brady taking the suspension at the time he did was a good call. At the time, 
          Patriots fans continued to lament about the numerous injustices associated with Brady's case. As some of you
          might know, you can be a fan of a sports team and then you can be THAT fan; the fan who gets so worked up about 
          anything that has to do with their favorite team that <i>they start to lose sight of human reason</i>. After all, it is just a game, being played by others. Yes, sitting down on the couch on Thanksgiving Day to watch football might as well be synonymous with the holiday itself, but I would argue that supporting a team should not put us in a place where that team's ups and downs dictate our own ups and downs (I'm really just calling myself out here). Exceptions would be made for players and those involved with the teams in some capacity (and even then, we can discuss how "life is bigger than football" or "life is bigger than __________"). 
          </p>

          <p>Here's where we rope in some thoughts about faith. Most of the frustrations expressed by Patriots fans in response to the NFL's "attack" on Tom Brady and the Patriots organization were centered around perceived injustices. Many thought the Wells Report was complete BS and stood by Brady and the team for this reason.
