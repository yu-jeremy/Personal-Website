# Personal-Website

This is the GitHub repository for my personal website, its creation is in progress. 

# Accessibility

My website can be accessed at [here](jeremyu.me) or at [http://jeremyu.me]. 

# Design

This website is being built using Bootstrap's HTML/CSS/JS framework. Use of Bootstrap's cards, carousels, and buttons are especially evident. Additionally, Bootstrap's clean and minimalistic aesthetic allows me to tell my story the way I want to. Other important design notes: I make use of GlyphIcons (by manually including the SVG files in my repo after downloading from the original creator's website, which can be found [here]http://glyphicons.com/).
